      Stuff I've made

    <ul class="projects">
      <li>
        <project>Potions!</project>
        Helps Skyrim players make optimal potion-making decisions.
        Made in static HTML, CSS, JS and some funky JSON I generated
        with Python from an obscure excel spreadsheet.

      <li>
        <project>Scroot</project>
        Funky Django hack. Makes version controlled
        and audited high-value Django models possible
        in MySQL MyISAM. Created instead of reusing an
        existing module because MyISAM doesn't have
        real transactions. Done in a single weekend.

      <li>
        <project>The CMS for this site</project>
        Made in Clojure, MongoDB, hosted on Heroku.

      </li>

      <li>
        <project>Dotfiles</project>
        I often use this to teach people how to write Emacs
        Lisp or configure their vim editor. Trivially
        redeployable so that I can hack comfortably anywhere
        there's a *nix.

      <li>
        <project>Github Dark Theme</project>
        Started from somebody else's work that I can't track down from awhile
        back, it's a dark theme for Github that actually works. I modified it
        to not look horrible. Might need an update soon.

      <li>
        <project>Clone of the original Hacker Typer.</project>
        Funny little hack to clone Hacker Typer for Emacs instead of the
        web. Mine involved a lot less code ;)

          Original hacker typer here!

      <li>
        <project>Thodol Wiki</project>
        Quickie micro-wiki. I wrote it for a friend who wanted
        something he could use but also hack on. I should rewrite
        it in Clojure soon.

      </li>

      <li>
        <project>Django Pagination</project>
        Pagination for Django, forked because original
        creator disappeared and there were bugs. Until Django
        added official pagination support, this was the only
        truly shake-n-bake pagination module that worked.

      </li>
      <li>
        <project>Redoot</project>
        The Reddit bot that gets you to buy crap from Woot!
        Rather than naively posting whatever is on woot directly
        to the subreddit as a submission, it treats it as a
        synchronization problem. It tracks what has already been
        posted by checking the posts on the subreddit to see if itâ€™d
        already posted something.

    <ul class="projects">
      <li>
        <project>HNOfficeHours</project>
        Designed to allow people to offer advice/expertise, or seek
        people offering advice for a given problem/specialty. Includes
        scheduling and search. Fun weekend hack from 2.5 years ago.
        Now deprecated in favor of better alternatives.
